Drawing as a means of understanding forms the basis for a semester-long project to be done in small groups. Case studies will center on concepts and systems that have not yet found their way into mainstream practice. The course approach will involve in-class presentations, project work, field trips, and case studies. WebCT will be used to expand the student's access to course materials and allow for a measure of distance learning. Sustainability: The notion that design intentions can be nullified through incorrect construction is stressed. The importance of proper detailing, construction, and maintenance to accomplish lasting and efficient enclosures is highlighted. Skills to diagnose and treat incorrect construction are developed.",

Students will also be coached in techniques to expand and develop musical ideas individually and as a framework for group improvisation.
