Drawing as a means of understanding forms the basis for a semester-long project to be done in small groups. Case studies will center on concepts and systems that have not yet found their way into mainstream practice. The course approach will involve in-class presentations, project work, field trips, and case studies. WebCT will be used to expand the student's access to course materials and allow for a measure of distance learning. Sustainability: The notion that design intentions can be nullified through incorrect construction is stressed. The importance of proper detailing, construction, and maintenance to accomplish lasting and efficient enclosures is highlighted. Skills to diagnose and treat incorrect construction are developed.",

To describe these choices the cause will introduce the concepts of opportunity cost, demand and supply theory, and market structures. It will consider the role of government in making resource allocation choices. Students will also study important macroeconomic data such as gross domestic product, economic growth rates, inflation, and unemployment. Additionally, studied will be the role of money and banking in the economy and short-run events such as recessions and expansions. Overall, the course will provide the student with an encompassing view of how economic principles and concepts relate to the broader economy and society.

An understanding of basic mechanical properties is established hands on by conducting tension, compression, and 3-point bending tests (mse-lab). Physical performance of material constructs as synergy between form and material properties is further illustrated. Experiments are conducted that introduce such major concepts as structural loading, properties of sections, and resulting system performance. Sustainability: The concept of life cycles is introduced; material and energy flows are tracked throughout the entire material life cycle. This will be accomplished alongside introducing major material groupings (metals, polymers, ceramics, and composites). Students come to realize that environmental concerns are directly related to structural composition and material availability. Consequences of resource extraction, distribution, manipulation, use, and disposal, reuse or recycle are addressed at both local and global scales. Selected field trips to materials extraction, processing, manufacturing, disposal, and recycling facilities are aimed to give physical meaning to the concept of life cycle.",

Students will then work on analyzing and interpreting the research results. Practice measurements will be scheduled in the gallery or somewhere on campus before trips to performance halls. MATLAB will play a central role throughout all the classes (SRL I & II) and the thesis research projects. It will be used during the class exercises . Within one week from the semester start, every student is required to INSTALL a functioning MATLAB Software package onto her/his laptop computer. B.S. and B.

The fundamentals of statics are presented in order to gain an understanding of the way in which external forces produce internal stresses in individual members and, in essence, flow through the building system to be resolved at the foundation level. The principles of strength of materials are studied to understand how particular structural materials and configurations manage to resist these forces without unacceptable distortions, or even failure. Wood structural properties are studied in all their complexity as a means to internalize the more theoretical topics broached. Through in-class presentations, reading, homework and project work, computer lab, field trips, and case studies, the student will be aided in developing this intuitive (while practical) understanding. It is recognized that intuitions of building technologies are not acquired quickly but result from much study, observation, and practice. Introduction to Structures makes use of the several approaches above to ensure that the beginning student is provided with a broad, solid base for future structural investigations. WebCT will be used to expand the student's access to course materials and allow for a measure of distance learning. Sustainability: the following notions are introduced as important attributes of sustainable structures and construction: durability and service life and life cycle cost.

    "description": "Architecture and painting are two of the oldest forms of societal expression and have been historically linked in complex and dynamic ways. In the 20th century, the movements of Cubism, Futurism, Neo-Plasticism, Constructivism, Purism, Surrealism, and Dadaism consisted of dynamic dialogs between architecture and painting. These exchanges allowed each to have a profound and deep impact upon the other. By contrast, in early 21st century, there seems to be all but a mute relationship between the two. This course intends to help break that silence. This course will begin to bridge the divide by establishing new connections between the current preoccupations with materials, procedures, and affects that are emerging in both contemporary painting and architecture. Twisted Siblings seeks to explore and discover new relationships between the most cutting-edge digital technologies and how painting may influence the expressive capacities of these technologies. As contemporary painting and architecture seek to establish future directions, a new dialog and exchange of ideas should be emerging, to ensure a dynamic and radical future for both. The course will consist of a series of lectures, discussions, and presentations. Students will be expected to research a number of individual architects, painters, and writers who are producing work of related interest. Students will be responsible for completing a research project, which synthesizes the content of the course.",
