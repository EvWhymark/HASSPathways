# HASS Pathways Backend Information

Currently, this backend folder has no code that is being used on the website actively. The only used files in this
directory are the files related to web scraping. The AdminPortal directory holds example code for what the admin portal
will use for JSON modifications and admin authentication. These files stopped being developed because of security
changes made by RPI. All folders in this file are being kept as an archive of code written to possibly be used as an 
example for future implementations for these features.
